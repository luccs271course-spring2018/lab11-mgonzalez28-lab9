- Try using a `TreeMap` and a `HashMap` instead of `MyHashMap`.
  1. Are the resulting word frequencies any different?
  1. Is the time performance any different? If so, how would you rank the three implementations (in increasing order of time complexity)?
- How are `%` and `Math.floorMod` different? Which works more reliably for computing a hash table index?
- What is the time complexity of `MyHashMap.size()`, and how could you make it much more efficient?
- How does this implementation compare to one where you would directly use your linked `Node` class from the earlier assignment? Answer briefly in terms of ease of implementation, correctness, reliability, and performance.
